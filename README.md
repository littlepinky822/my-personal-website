# My First Portfolio Website

This is my first portfolio website, which is a showcase of my work and accomplishments. The website is built using HTML, CSS, Flask framework and a little bit of JavaScript. The website includes information about me, my skills, and my contact information.

Nothing fancy here. But well... We all start somewhere, right?
